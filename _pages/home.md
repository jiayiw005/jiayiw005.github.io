### About Me

I am an undergraduate student at Brown University studying Mathematics-Computer Science and International and Public Affairs. As a student researcher and advocate, I'm excited about anything broadly related to **alignment**, **technical AI governance**, and **complex systems**.

When probing into theories that configures higher-level **design** and **policy** decisions, I'm also making my way to explore downstream, grassroots solutions that center **community-driven technologies**.
