### About Me

I am an undergraduate student at Brown University, studying in Mathematics-Computer Science and Urban Studies. As a student researcher and advocate, I'm excited about anything broadly related to **complex systems**, as well as **relevant AI/ML theory and applications**: 
- Complex systems and sociotechnical infrastructure/governance (for urban landscapes and workplace algorithmic management in particular)
- AI alignment and participatory design, featuring fairness, interpretability, and auditing
- Symbolic systems, multi-agent systems for language agents
- Intersections of any terms above
- ...

When probing into theories that configures higher-level **design** and **policy** decisions, I'm also making my way to explore downstream, grassroots solutions that center **community-driven technologies**. 
   


#### My Work

I work with a variety of labs, organizations, and initiatives in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Liangshan, and Providence. Here is a list of selected projects: 
- Toward Labor-Inclusive Food Delivery Algorithmic Management: Cross-Platforms Case Studies, Computational Approaches, and Regulatory Alternatives, Advised by [Harini Suresh](https://harinisuresh.com/) at [The Data in Society Collective (DISCO Lab)](https://discolab.cs.brown.edu/) and CSCI 2952W *Critical Data and Machine Learning Studies*
- Atypical Combination and Scientific Impact in Computational Sciences, Advised by [Huilian Sophie Qiu](https://www.sophiehsqq.com/index.html) at [Northwestern Institute on Complex Systems (NICO)](https://www.nico.northwestern.edu/)
- AsyLex-Based Refugee Claim Entity Extraction and Judgement Prediction [[Project Repository]](https://github.com/jiayiw005/refugee-claim-classifier), Advised by [Gillian Sochor](https://theorg.com/org/ai4all/org-chart/gillian-sochor) at AI4ALL Ignite Fellowship
- Algorithmic (AI/ML) Fairness Research for Socially Responsible Computing (SRC) Handbook [[Handbook]](https://src-handbook-infrastructure-team.github.io/srch/), Advised by [Suresh Venkatasubramanian](https://dsi.brown.edu/people/suresh-venkatasubramanian) and [Julia Netter](http://www.julianetter.de/) at Brown Uiversity Department of Computer Science and [Center for Technology Responsibility (CNTR)](https://cntr.brown.edu/)
- ...

A comprehensive list is available in [Projects](https://jiayiw005.github.io/projects/) and my [CV](https://jiayiw005.github.io/cv/cv.pdf). Please feel free to [reach out](mailto:jiayi_wu4@brown.edu) if you have any questions, ideas, or would like to work with me! 

#### Something Else

I enjoy random codes, historical/science fictions, dumbell workout, roaming around residential urban villages ([Guangzhou](https://earth.google.com/earth/d/1YTg7TO4ODp5iSL_rj1xVqPlo7tOaysCh?usp=sharing)/Shanghai, where I lived and volunteeredüè†), crafting collages/zines, and doing plank challenges ;")
