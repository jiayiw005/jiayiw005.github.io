### About Me

I am an undergraduate student at Brown University, studying in Mathematics-Computer Science and Urban Studies. As a student researcher and advocate, I'm excited about anything broadly related to **complex systems**, as well as relevant theories and applications of **technical AI governance**: 
- Complex systems and sociotechnical infrastructure/governance (for urban landscapes and workplace algorithmic management in particular)
- AI alignment and technical governance, featuring fairness, interpretability, and (participatory) supply-chain audits
- Symbolic systems, multi-agentic architectures
- Intersections of any terms above
- ...

When probing into theories that configures higher-level **design** and **policy** decisions, I'm also making my way to explore downstream, grassroots solutions that center **community-driven technologies**. 
   


#### My Work
I work for/with a variety of labs, organizations, and initiatives. Here is a list of selected projects:
- Toward Deliverer-Centered Food Delivery Algorithmic Management: Cross-Platforms Case Studies, Computational Approaches, and Regulatory Alternatives [[Preprint]]()[[Project Repository]](https://github.com/jiayiw005/delivery-alg-simulation), Advised by [Harini Suresh](https://harinisuresh.com/) at [The Data in Society Collective (DISCO Lab)](https://discolab.cs.brown.edu/) and CSCI 2952W *Critical Data and Machine Learning Studies*
- Atypical Combination and Scientific Impact in Computational Sciences, Advised by [Huilian Sophie Qiu](https://www.sophiehsqq.com/index.html) at [Northwestern Institute on Complex Systems (NICO)](https://www.nico.northwestern.edu/)
- Algorithmic (AI/ML) Fairness Research for Socially Responsible Computing (SRC) Handbook [[Handbook]](https://srch.cs.brown.edu), Advised by [Suresh Venkatasubramanian](https://dsi.brown.edu/people/suresh-venkatasubramanian) and [Julia Netter](http://www.julianetter.de/) at Brown Uiversity Department of Computer Science and [Center for Technology Responsibility (CNTR)](https://cntr.brown.edu/)

#### Misc

I enjoy random codes, historical/science fictions, dumbell workout, roaming around residential urban villages ([Guangzhou](https://earth.google.com/earth/d/1YTg7TO4ODp5iSL_rj1xVqPlo7tOaysCh?usp=sharing)/Shanghai, where I lived and volunteeredüè†), crafting collages/zines, and doing plank challenges ;")
