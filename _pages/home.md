### About Me

I am an undergraduate student at Brown University studying Mathematics-Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. 

As a student researcher and engineer, I'm interested in theoretical foundations of **alignment** and **trustworthy machine learning**, situated within broader questions of *technical AI governance* and *complex systems*. I aim to bridge computational complexity, formal logic, and game-theoretic frameworks with the design and auditing of accountable AI systems. 


#### My Work
Here is a list of selected [projects](https://jiayiw005.github.io/projects/):
- Benchmarking Overton Pluralism in LLMs, in collaboration with [Elinor Poole-Dayan](https://elinorp-d.github.io/) *et al.*, advised by [Michiel Bakker](https://miba.dev/), accepted to NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on [Evaluating the Evolving LLM Lifecycle: Benchmarks, Emergent Abilities, and Scaling](https://sites.google.com/view/llm-eval-workshop/)

#### Misc

I work for/with a range of organizations and initiatives including [HOPE Vocational Education Academy](https://www.lncf.cn/edu/item/31.html), Period Pride, [Housing Opportunities for People Everywhere](https://www.linkedin.com/company/housing-opportunities-for-people-everywhere-hope/) (again HOPE!), etc. 

In my spare time, I enjoy cold brew, taking on plank challenges (‚â•7min), and roaming through residential the urban neighborhoods where I lived and volunteeredüè† ;")
