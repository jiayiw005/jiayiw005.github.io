### About Me

I am an undergraduate student at Brown University, studying in Mathematics-Computer Science and International and Public Affairs. As a student researcher and advocate, I'm excited about anything broadly related to **complex systems**, as well as relevant theories and applications of **technical AI governance**.

When probing into theories that configures higher-level **design** and **policy** decisions, I'm also making my way to explore downstream, grassroots solutions that center **community-driven technologies**.
   


#### My Work

#### Misc

I enjoy random codes, historical/science fictions, dumbell workout, roaming around residential urban villages ([Guangzhou](https://earth.google.com/earth/d/1YTg7TO4ODp5iSL_rj1xVqPlo7tOaysCh?usp=sharing)/Shanghai, where I lived and volunteeredüè†), crafting collages/zines, and doing plank challenges ;")
