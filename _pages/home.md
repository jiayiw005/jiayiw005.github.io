### About Me

I am a first-year undergraduate student at Brown University, concentrating in Mathematics-Computer Science and Urban Studies. As a student researcher and developer, I'm excited about anything broadly related to symbolic systems, sociotechnical infrastructures, and participatory or distributed AI. I'm also making my way to explore downstream, grassroots solutions that center and empower community-driven technologies. 
   


#### My Work

I worked with a variety of organizations and initiatives in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Liangshan, and Providence. Here is a list of my ongoing projects: 
- Towards Labor-Aware Algorithmic Management for Gig Work: A Critical Study of Chinaâ€™s Food Delivery Platforms, Advised by Harini Suresh
- AsyLex-Based Refugee Claim Entity Extraction and Judgement Prediction [[Project Repository]](https://github.com/jiayiw005/refugee-claim-classifier), Advised by Gillian Sochor
- The Intractable Other: Modeling Linguistic Reappropriations and Algospeak in Chinese Online (Counter)Subculture, Advised by Simeon Sayers
- ...

A comprehensive list is available in [Projects](https://jiayiw005.github.io/projects/) and my [CV](https://jiayiw005.github.io/cv/cv.pdf). Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions, ideas, or would like to work with me! 

#### Something Else

In my spare time, I love walking aimlessly around residential urban villages, crafting collage/zine, and doing plank challenges ;")

Besides, take a look my [terminal-style website experiment]()!
