### About Me

I am a first-year undergraduate student at Brown University, concentrating in Mathematics-Computer Science and Urban Studies. As a student researcher and developer, I'm excited about anything broadly related to symbolic systems, sociotechnical **infrastructures**, and participatory or distributed AI. 

I'd describe my approach as some entangled dualities: when it involves probing into theory research that configures higher-level policy decisions, I'm also making my way to explore downstream, grassroots solutions that center and empower community-driven technologies. 
   


#### My Work

I work with a variety of labs, organizations, and initiatives in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Liangshan, and Providence. Here is a list of my projects: 
- Open-Sourced Android Mobile Application for Educational Resource Sharing [[GitHub Repository]](https://github.com/jiayiw005/converter-android-app), at Converter Education Initiative
- Towards Labor-Aware Algorithmic Management for Gig Work: A Critical Study of China‚Äôs Food Delivery Platforms, Advised by [Harini Suresh](https://harinisuresh.com/) at [The Data in Society Collective (DISCO Lab)](https://discolab.cs.brown.edu/) and CSCI 2952W Critical Data and Machine Learning Studies
- AsyLex-Based Refugee Claim Entity Extraction and Judgement Prediction [[Project Repository]](https://github.com/jiayiw005/refugee-claim-classifier), Advised by [Gillian Sochor](https://theorg.com/org/ai4all/org-chart/gillian-sochor) at AI4ALL Ignite Accelerator
- AI Primer Research for Socially Responsible Computing (SRC) Handbook [[Handbook]](https://src-handbook-infrastructure-team.github.io/srch/), Advised by [Suresh Venkatasubramanian](https://dsi.brown.edu/people/suresh-venkatasubramanian) and [Julia Netter](http://www.julianetter.de/) at Brown Uiversity Department of Computer Science and [Center for Technology Responsibility (CNTR)](https://cntr.brown.edu/)
- ...

A comprehensive list is available in [Projects](https://jiayiw005.github.io/projects/) and my [CV](https://jiayiw005.github.io/cv/cv.pdf). Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions, ideas, or would like to work with me! 

#### Something Else

I enjoy random codes, historical/science fictions, dumbell workout, roaming around residential urban villages (Guangzhou/Shanghai, where I lived and volunteeredüè†), crafting collages/zines, and doing plank challenges ;")

Besides, take a look my [terminal-style website experiment]()!
