### About Me

I am an undergraduate student at Brown University studying Mathematics-Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. As a student researcher and engineer, I'm interested in theoretical underpinnings of **alignment**, **reliability**, and **interpretability**, situated within broader questions of *technical AI governance* and *complex systems*.

When probing into theories that configures higher-level **design** and **policy** decisions, I'm also making my way to explore downstream solutions that center **community-driven technologies**.
