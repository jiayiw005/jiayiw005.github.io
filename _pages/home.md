#### About Me

I am a first-year undergraduate student at Brown University, concentrating in Mathematics-Computer Science and Urban Studies. As a student researcher and developer, I'm broadly excited about anything related to symbolic systems, sociotechnical infrastructures, and participatory or distributed AI. I'm also making my way to explore downstream (ideally grassroots) solutions that leverage technologies to empower marginalized communities.
   


#### My Work

I worked with a variety of organizations and initiatives in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Liangshan, and Providence. Here is a list of my ongoing projects: 
- Moderation or Exploitation? A Study of Algorithmic Management Behind Chinaâ€™s Food Delivery Platforms
  [[Research Paper]](https://docs.google.com/document/), Advised by Harini Suresh
- AsyLex-Based Refugee-Claim Entity Extraction and Judgement Prediction [[Project Repository]](https://docs.google.com/document/), Advised by Gillian Sochor
- The Intractable Other: Modeling Linguistic Reappropriations and Algospeak in Chinese Online (Counter)Subculture [[Research Paper in Progress...]](), Advised by Simeon Sayers
- ...

A comprehensive list is available in [Projects](http://localhost:4000/projects/) and my [CV](https://docs.google.com/document/). Please feel free to contact me if you have any ideas and would like to work with me! 

#### Something Else

In my spare time, I love walking aimlessly around residential urban villages, crafting collage/zine, and doing plank challenges ;")

Besides, take a look my [terminal-style website experiment](https://docs.google.com/document/)!
