### About Me

Hi! I'm an undergraduate studying Mathematics-Computer Science and Applied Mathematics at Brown University. 

As a student researcher and engineer, I‚Äôm interested in **alignment** and **trustworthy machine learning**. Driven by my applied work in benchmarking and auditing AI systems, I'm exploring how frameworks from computational complexity, formal verification, and game theory can inform the limits, guarantees, and dynamics of accountable AI systems within the broader landscape of technical AI governance and complex systems. 


#### My Work
Here is a list of selected [projects](https://jiayiw005.github.io/projects/):
- Benchmarking Overton Pluralism in LLMs, in collaboration with [Elinor Poole-Dayan](https://elinorp-d.github.io/) *et al.*, advised by [Michiel Bakker](https://miba.dev/), accepted to NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on [Evaluating the Evolving LLM Lifecycle: Benchmarks, Emergent Abilities, and Scaling](https://sites.google.com/view/llm-eval-workshop/)
- Motifs of Thought: Reusable Abstractions for LLM Reasoning, in collaboration with Chance Jiajie Li *et al.*
  - Position: Simulating Society Requires Simulating Thought [[Preprint]](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2506.06958), accepted to Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) 2025, Position Paper Track
  - HugAgent: Evaluating LLMs in Simulating Human-Like Individual Reasoning on Open-Ended Tasks [[Preprint]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.15144) [[Repository]](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/HugAgent/) accepted to to NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on [LAW 2025: Bridging Language, Agent, and World Models](https://sites.google.com/view/law-2025)
- Algorithmic Fairness and AI Governance Research for Socially Responsible Computing (SRC) Handbook [[Handbook]](https://srch.cs.brown.edu), advised by [Suresh Venkatasubramanian](https://dsi.brown.edu/people/suresh-venkatasubramanian) and [Julia Netter](http://www.julianetter.de/)

#### Misc

I work for/with a range of community organizations and initiatives: [HOPE Vocational Education Academy](https://www.lncf.cn/edu/item/31.html), [Period Pride](https://ssir.org/articles/entry/ending_period_shame_and_poverty_in_asia), [House of Hope CDC](https://thehouseofhopecdc.org/) (again HOPE!), [Brown China Care](https://chinacarebrown.wixsite.com/home), etc. These engagements continue to shape my understanding of the friction between formal models and on-the-ground complexities. 

In my spare time, I enjoy cold brew, taking on plank challenges (‚â•7min), and roaming through the urban neighborhoods where I lived and volunteeredüè† ;")
